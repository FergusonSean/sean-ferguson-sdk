# The One SDK

> SDK for accessing LOTR api hosted at https://the-one-api.dev/

## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 14 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
7.24.0
v16.10.0
```

## Installation

To install:

```sh
$ npm install --save @seanferguson/the-one-sdk
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add @seanferguson/the-one-sdk
```

## Usage


```js
const { Client } = require('@seanferguson/the-one-sdk')

// initialize client with your personal api token
const client = new Client({ token: process.env.API_TOKEN })

// make requests to the api
const quotes = await client.getMovieQuotes('5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5b')

```

### Retry

If any of your requests recieve a rate limit we will retry 10 times before returning a failure. We insert an exponential backoff in wait times between retries starting with 2 seconds.

### Pagination

Pagination for relevant endpoints is done by passing an options object to the call with any of the pagination fields documented [here.](https://the-one-api.dev/documentation#5) This is entirely optional and if omitted will default to sane values

At the time of this writing the options are:
1. limit - the maximum number of results to return
2. offset - the number of entries to skip
3. page -  a shorthand for setting offset to limit * page

### Sorting

Sorting for relevant endpoints is done by passing an options object to the call with the sort option specified [here.](https://the-one-api.dev/documentation#5) This is entirely optional.

### Filters

Filtering for relevant endpoints is done by passing an options object to the call with the filters option specified. The filters object is of the following format:

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.MATCH, // or other operators as desired
    value: 'the value I was looking for',
  }
}
```

See a below list of potential operators and the corresponding valid values

#### Operators

##### MATCH

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.MATCH,
    value: 'the value I was looking for',
  }
}
```

The MATCH operator accepts a primitive type, an array, or a RegExp as it's value. If the value is a primitive type it checks for records matching the value exactly. If the value is an array it checks for an exact match with any of the values in the array. If the value is a RegExp object it will check for objects whose values match that regular expression. 

Using RegExp in a match has undefined behavior if the field being filtered on is not a string field.

##### NOT\_MATCH

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.NOT_MATCH,
    value: 'the value I was looking for',
  }
}
```

The NOT\_MATCH operator is a reversed version of the match operator. See Above for details

##### EXISTS

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.EXISTS,
  }
}
```

the EXISTS operator checks for the existence of the field in question. It does not require a value and if one is provided it will be ignored.

##### NOT\_EXISTS

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.EXISTS,
  }
}
```

The NOT\_EXISTS operator checks for the non-existence of the field in question. It does not require a value and if one is provided it will be ignored.

##### GT

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.GT,
    value: 7,
  }
}
```

The GT operator checks for records with a field greater than the value provided. the value provided must be of the same type as the field.

##### GTE

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.GTE,
    value: 7,
  }
}
```

The GTE operator checks for records with a field greater than or equal to the value provided. the value provided must be of the same type as the field.

##### LT

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.LT,
    value: 7,
  }
}
```

The LT operator checks for records with a field less than the value provided. the value provided must be of the same type as the field.

##### LTE

```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: {
    op: OPS.LTE,
    value: 7,
  }
}
```

The LTE operator checks for records with a field less than or equal to the value provided. the value provided must be of the same type as the field.

### Available calls

#### getMovieQuotes

```js
const { Client } = require('@seanferguson/the-one-sdk')

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.API_TOKEN })

const quotes = await client.getMovieQuotes('5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5b', {
  sort: 'dialog:asc',
  limit: 1000,
  page: 1,
  offset: 3,
})
```


#### getMovie

```js
const { Client } = require('@seanferguson/the-one-sdk')

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.API_TOKEN })

const movie = await client.getMovie('5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5b')
```
#### getMovies

```js
const { Client, OPS } = require('@seanferguson/the-one-sdk')

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.API_TOKEN })

const quotes = await client.getMovieQuotes('5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5b', {
  sort: 'dialog:asc',
  limit: 1000,
  page: 1,
  offset: 3,
  filters: {
    academyAwardWins: {
      op: OPS.GTE,
      value: 11
    },
    otherFieldToFilterOn: {
      op: OPS.MATCH,
      value: 'exactValueYouAreLookingFor'
    }
  }
})
```



For more usage examples check out the tests :)

## Potential Future Improvements

1. Add shorthand for exist filters
```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: true
}
```

2. Add shorthand for not exist filters
```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: false
}
```

3. Add shorthand for match filters
```js
{
  fieldYouWouldLikeToFilterOn: 'theExactMatchOrArrayOrRegex you are looking for'
}
```

4. Add simple way to insert test stub to enable easily mocking the package in tests
5. Add typing for returned values
5. Add typing for valid filter keys
7. Allow configuration of retry behavior
